>Bootstrap method with heuristic search:
>  Number of bootstrap replicates = 200
>  Starting seed = generated automatically
>  Number of characters resampled in each replicate = 1149
>  Optimality criterion = distance (unweighted least squares (power=0))
>    Negative branch lengths allowed, but set to zero for tree-score calculation
>    Distance measure = HKY85
>  Starting tree(s) obtained via neighbor-joining
>  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) with reconnection limit = 8
>    Steepest descent option not in effect
>  Initial 'Maxtrees' setting = 100
>  Zero-length branches not collapsed
>  'MulTrees' option in effect
>  No topological constraints in effect
>  Trees are unrooted
>
>  200 bootstrap replicates completed
>  Time used = 5.21 sec (CPU time = 5.13 sec)
